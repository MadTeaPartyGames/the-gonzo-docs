{: .fs-9 .fw-700 }
[Home](https://madteapartygames.github.io/the-gonzo-docs/){: .btn .btn-purple }
[Quick Start](https://madteapartygames.github.io/the-gonzo-docs/docs/quickstart.html){: .btn .btn-purple }
[The Gonzo Way](https://madteapartygames.github.io/the-gonzo-docs/docs/deepdive.html){: .btn .btn-purple }

## Current Recommendations:
{: .fs-7 .fw-700 }
These are plugins that I currently use, and many of them I could not imagine working without. 

### GAS Companion:
{: .fs-5 .fw-700 }
[GSC](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/gas-companion){: .btn .btn-purple }

> This plugin is a must if you want to leverage Unreal's GAS, but do not want to deep dive into C++, or like me, you do not want to deal with the boilerplate stuff yourself. This is probably the plugin I recommend the most, and would easily have paid x4 what it costs. 

### TwistedBytes Interaction System:
{: .fs-5 .fw-700 }
[TBIA](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/twistedbytes-interaction-system){: .btn .btn-purple }

>This is a GAS powered interaction system that I can't recommend enough. It is extremely well made and gives a quick and easy way to add AAA level interaction features into your game. 

### Skinned Decal Component:
{: .fs-5 .fw-700 }
[SDC](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/skinned-decal-component){: .btn .btn-purple }

>This is the perfect example of how something should be out-of-the-box for Unreal. Once you see these decals in action on skeletal meshes there is no going back. Easily worth the full price that I paid for it, and it does constantly show up in Epic sales.

### Easy Utility AI:
{: .fs-5 .fw-700 }
[EAI](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/easy-utility-ai){: .btn .btn-purple }

>I am a huge fan of Utility Theory in AI, I hate Behavior Trees, and I love Gameplay Tags. This plugin covers all of these and then some. With Utility Theory and Gameplay Tags you can quickly create robust AI, all in standard Blueprint Graphs.

### Electronic Nodes:
{: .fs-5 .fw-700 }
[ENodes](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/electronic-nodes){: .btn .btn-purple }

>Purely visual, but once you get rid of the mushy spaghetti, there is no going back. If you don't have this, buy it today or wait for a sale if you really must. This is also something that should be standard in the engine at this point.
