### The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.

**GonzoFX** ia a plugin that is intended to allow for quick and easy post process effects. Some of them are common effects, others are intended to add some trippy mind altering effects. A single actor built in C++ to be as performant as possible. 

Both the namesake and several of the effects are a direct homage and heavily inspired by my long time love for the life and work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. _The **Gonzo** Way_. 

Follow the links below to begin your journey to the edge and back again.

_It never got weird enough for me_.
